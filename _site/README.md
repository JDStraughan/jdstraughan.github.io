This is the source code to my personal blog.  Feel free to use it as a way to understand how I have implemented jekyll, liquid, plugins, etc.  Feel free to use any code, techniques, methods, or bad habits I have used.  If you find a bug, error, or bad habit that you can fix, please issue a pull request.  Lifting the site and making it your own without any attribution will result in bad karma.
